            Bunker 19 was bunker founded in Feburary 2019
            by Comradrian troops during the Tem-Comrade war.
            I was built using the magic of duct-tape and run
            by Robot Stalin. It included three rooms, the mainroom,
            under staircase backroom, and cardboard bunker. It had
            a mail system, an alarm, vault, rations box, and trash
            can.

            After the death of Robot Stalin to the Wuhan Virus

            a renewal plan for the project under her supervision.

            Although she said she would make policy changes to
            end the rights abuses, she stated "Mr. Hedgehog would
            not be unhanged". She further announced that left and 
            right blahaj would manage the bunker and there are
            no plans to restore the cardboard bunker. She also
            announced reforms to Comradrian citizenship in the
            distupted territory where the bunker resides.
