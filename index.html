            My name is Aidan O'Brien I'm a first year in Software Engineering at RIT(obvious), and I
            am from Webster, New York which is 30 minutes from here. I went to Webster Thomas High
            School, and I took all the computer science classes. Some of my hobbies include Speedcubing,
            Magic the Gathering, and Non-Competive Videogames such as Minecraft.
